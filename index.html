        <h2>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h2>
        <p>Ambitious Full Stack Web Developer who recently earned a certificate through University of California, Riverside bootcamp extension. Through this course I’ve acquired skills in React.jss, JavaScript, and MERN stacks. I’ve worked with a group to make a few cutting-edge applications and one using the MERN stack. My work experience consists of sales, customer service, and management. For 3 years I’ve been the Assistant Manager in Automotive where I have to meet deadlines on a daily basis. I seek to draw on past experiences and knowledge to bring my career in full-stack development to the next level. I look forward to bringing my fresh skills in web development to enhance the user experience.
